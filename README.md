# Privacy Statement

This app respects your privacy. Here's what you need to know:

- **Location Data:** We use your location (obtained either via your IP address for an initial estimate or directly from your device's GPS if you grant permission) solely to fetch relevant weather forecasts from the Open-Meteo API and display location names via the Nominatim API. Your precise location is processed to get weather data but is not stored long-term on any server controlled by us after the forecast is retrieved.
- **Local Storage:** Your last searched/selected location and app settings (like theme and units) are stored _only_ on your device using MMKV storage. This data is not transmitted elsewhere.
- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, or share any other personally identifiable information (like name, email, contacts).
- **Third-Party Services:** The app uses third-party services for weather (Open-Meteo), location search (Nominatim/OpenStreetMap), and IP-based geolocation (ip-api.com, ipify.org). Please refer to their respective privacy policies for how they handle data.
- **Analytics:** No user analytics are currently collected.
