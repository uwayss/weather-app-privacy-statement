    <h1>Privacy Policy for EasyWeather</h1>

    <p class="date">Effective Date: April 5, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how EasyWeather ("we," "us," or "our")
      collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application
      (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Data:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Approximate Location (IP-based):</strong> When you first
            open the App or if precise location is unavailable/denied, we may
            infer your approximate location based on your IP address using
            third-party services (like ip-api.com, ipify.org). This is used
            solely to provide an initial relevant weather forecast.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Precise Location (GPS-based):</strong> If you grant the App
            permission, we will collect your device's precise GPS location. This
            allows us to provide the most accurate weather forecast for your
            current location. You can revoke this permission at any time through
            your device settings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em
          >We send your coordinates (approximate or precise latitude and
          longitude) to our weather data provider (Open-Meteo) to fetch
          forecasts. We do not store your precise location history on our
          servers.</em
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Search Queries:</strong> When you search for a location, the
        query text is sent to a third-party geocoding service
        (Nominatim/OpenStreetMap) to find matching locations and their
        coordinates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Locally Stored Data (On Your Device Only):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Last Location:</strong> We store your last searched/selected
            location (display name, latitude, longitude) on your device using
            MMKV storage for your convenience, so the App remembers it next time
            you open it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences for theme
            (light/dark/system) and units (Metric/Imperial) are stored locally
            on your device using MMKV storage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em
          >This locally stored data is not transmitted to us or any third
          party.</em
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Analytics Information (Optional - Via Third-Party SDKs like Firebase
          Analytics):</strong
        >
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with
            the App, such as screens viewed, features used (e.g., location
            search, settings changes), session duration, and button taps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system
            version, unique device identifiers (like Advertising ID, if
            available and permitted by platform policies), IP address (may be
            used for coarse location estimate by the SDK), app version, and
            carrier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Crash and Performance Data:</strong> If the App crashes or
            experiences performance issues, diagnostic information may be
            collected to help us identify and fix bugs (e.g., via Firebase
            Crashlytics, Sentry). This may include device state, app state at
            the time of the crash, and stack traces.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Advertising Information (Optional - Via Third-Party SDKs like Google
          AdMob):</strong
        >
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Advertising ID (IDFA/AAID) to
            serve personalized ads (subject to your device settings) and measure
            ad performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IP Address:</strong> May be used by the ad network for
            coarse location targeting and fraud prevention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ad Interaction Data:</strong> Information about the ads
            shown to you and your interactions with them (e.g., clicks, views).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        To provide you with accurate and relevant weather forecasts based on
        your current or selected location.
      </li>
      <li>To enable location searching functionality.</li>
      <li>
        To remember your preferences (last location, theme, units) for a better
        user experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>(If Analytics Integrated):</strong> To understand how users
        interact with the App, identify popular features, diagnose crashes,

        experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>(If Ads Integrated):</strong> To display advertisements within
        the App, which helps support its development and maintenance. Ads may be
        personalized based on identifiers and usage data, subject to platform
        policies and your device settings.
      </li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>
      Location and settings data are stored locally on your device using MMKV
      storage. Data sent to third-party services is handled according to their
      respective privacy policies and security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security
      measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
      alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or electronic
      transmission is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
      security.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Permissions:</strong> You can enable or disable
        location services for the App at any time through your device settings.
        If disabled, weather will be based on your last selected location or IP
        address.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App Settings:</strong> You can change your theme and unit
        preferences directly within the App's settings screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Personalized Advertising:</strong> You may be able to limit ad
        tracking or opt-out of personalized advertising using the settings on
        your mobile device (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads
        Personalization" on Android). This will not stop ads from being shown,
        but they may be less relevant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accessing or Deleting Local Data:</strong> Locally stored
        settings and last location can be effectively cleared by uninstalling
        the App or clearing the App's data through your device settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-Party Data:</strong> For information collected by
        third-party services (Analytics, Ads), please refer to their respective
        privacy policies (linked above) for information on accessing or managing
        that data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the
      relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected
      personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete
      such information as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our
      website and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to
      review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
