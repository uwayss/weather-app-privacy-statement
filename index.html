    <h1>Privacy Policy for EasyWeather</h1>

    <p class="date">Effective Date: April 5, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how EasyWeather ("we," "us," or "our")
      collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application
      (the "App"). <strong>By using the App, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Data:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Approximate Location (IP-based):</strong> When you first
            open the App or if precise location is unavailable/denied, we may
            infer your approximate location based on your IP address using
            third-party services (like ip-api.com, ipify.org). This is used
            solely to provide an initial relevant weather forecast.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Precise Location (GPS-based):</strong> If you grant the App
            permission, we will collect your device's precise GPS location. This
            allows us to provide the most accurate weather forecast for your
            current location. You can revoke this permission at any time through
            your device settings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em>
          We send your coordinates (approximate or precise latitude and
          longitude) to our weather data provider (Open-Meteo) to fetch
          forecasts. <strong>We do not store any precise or approximate location history on our servers.</strong>
        </em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Search Queries:</strong> When you search for a location, the
        query text is sent to a third-party geocoding service
        (Nominatim/OpenStreetMap) to find matching locations and their
        coordinates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Locally Stored Data (On Your Device Only):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Last Location:</strong> We store your last searched/selected
            location (display name, latitude, longitude) on your device using
            MMKV storage for your convenience, so the App remembers it next time
            you open it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences for theme
            (light/dark/system) and units (Metric/Imperial) are stored locally
            on your device using MMKV storage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em>
          <strong>This locally stored data is not transmitted to us or any third party.</strong>
        </em>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To provide you with accurate and relevant weather forecasts based on
        your current or selected location.
      </li>
      <li>To enable location searching functionality.</li>
      <li>
        To remember your preferences (last location, theme, units) for a better
        user experience.
      </li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <p>
      We may share your information with the following third parties only as
      necessary to provide the App's functionality or as described below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Weather Data Provider (Open-Meteo):</strong> We share latitude
        and longitude coordinates to retrieve weather forecasts. See
        Open-Meteo's Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/terms#privacy" target="_blank"
          >Link to Open-Meteo Policy</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Search Provider (Nominatim/OpenStreetMap):</strong> We
        share your search query to find locations. Nominatim usage is subject to
        OpenStreetMap Foundation's policies. See Nominatim's Usage Policy:
        <a href="https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy" target="_blank"
          >Link to Nominatim Policy</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>IP Geolocation Services (ip-api.com, ipify.org):</strong> Your
        IP address is sent to these services to determine approximate location.
        See their respective policies:
        <a href="https://ip-api.com/docs/legal" target="_blank"
          >Link to ip-api Policy</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if
        required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in
        good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect
        your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a
        government request.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>
      Location and settings data are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong> using MMKV
      storage. <strong>We do not store any personal data on our servers.</strong> Data sent to third-party services is handled according to their
      respective privacy policies and security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security
      measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
      alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or electronic
      transmission is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
      security.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Permissions:</strong> You can enable or disable
        location services for the App at any time through your device settings.
        If disabled, weather will be based on your last selected location or IP
        address.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App Settings:</strong> You can change your theme and unit
        preferences directly within the App's settings screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accessing or Deleting Local Data:</strong> Locally stored
        settings and last location can be effectively cleared by uninstalling
        the App or clearing the App's data through your device settings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the
      relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected
      personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete
      such information as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our
      website and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to
      review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
